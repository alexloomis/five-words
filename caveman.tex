You are all cavemen.
Each player chooses five one-syllable words.
These are the only words they can say for the rest of the game.
The GM chooses a simple task for the players,
e.g. ``hunt the mammoth''
or ``get out of the rain,'' % chktex 38
without telling them what it is.
Using only caveman-talk,
the GM describes to players their situation,
and tries to help them complete the task.
The players, using only their chosen words,
attempt to narrate their actions.
To supplement the players' five words,
wild gesticulation is not only permitted,
it is encouraged.
When at least one of the players has successfully completed the task,
the GM signals their success by jumping and hooting
like an ape from \emph{2001: A Space Odeyssey}.
The players join in,
indicating their excitement,
after which point the GM narrates in plain English
what the initial scenario was,
as well as the task.
This ends the game.
